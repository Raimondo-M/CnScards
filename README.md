Simple code to create cards for TTRPG, done based on Crown and Skull from Runehammer games
1) Fill the CSV file with the descriptions of your cards.
2) If you have images for the cards, place them in a folder named "pics." Make sure each image has the same name as the corresponding card in the CSV file.
3) Execute the 'cards_gen.py' script to generate the cards.

Additional notes:
* You can use different CSV files for your cards. Just change the file name in the 'cards_gen.py' script to match your new CSV file. This also applies to changing templates, fonts, and other elements.
* If you have multiple cards, images, or descriptions with the same name, you can differentiate them by adding _1, _2, etc., to the end of their names. Note that the name printed on the card will not include these numbers.
